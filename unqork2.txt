Data Types
String: Text Field, Text Area, Date Input, Radio Buttons, and Phone Number components

Number:
Tip: The Number component has a Don't Allow Decimals setting. If you only want to accept integer values, you can switch the Don't Allow Decimals toggle to ON.
number: 10
textfieldNumber: "10"

Boolean:  Boolean value, checked stores as true and unchecked stores as false.
singleCheckbox: true
textFieldTrue: "true"

Data Structures:
3 basic data structures in the Unqork Designer Platform:

Key/value pairs:- Components that store data using key/value pairs include: Text Field, Text Area, Hidden, Phone Number, Radio Buttons, and more.

Objects:- object acts as a container for characteristics about that entity
Note: JSON uses curly braces ({...}) to denote objects.
intiPhone:
     countryCode: "US"
     internationalNumber: "+12015556743"
     number: "(201) 555-6743"
Notice that the object intlPhone actually contains 3 key/value pairs. intlPhone is a single, self-contained entity. It's simply the number entered in Express View. But, the component actually stores 3 related characteristics of that number:


Arrays:- Arrays can contain values, objects, and even other arrays.
Note: JSON denotes arrays using square brackets ([...]).

JSON denotes arrays using square brackets ([...]).

JSON denotes objects using curly braces ({...}).

Strings always have double quotes.

Introduction to Data & Events Processing
Unqork has a group of Data & Events Processing components for this very purpose. These components use logic to make your module respond in different ways depending on your end-user's input.
Data & Event Processing components include:

File
License Scanner*
DataMapper*
Decisions
Initializer
Plug-In
Calculator
Data Table*
Checkpoint
Data Workflow
Timer
Plaid*
File Storage*

Uploaded files become available to view, download, or delete

The DataMapper component commonly uses IF statements. IF statements let you make logical decisions based on an input value.
 IF statements typically look like this: =IF(Something is True, then do something, otherwise do something else).


Note: The DataMapper and Data Workflow components both manipulate data. Generally speaking, the Data Workflow component is the more popular choice. 
Sometimes, creators use the DataMapper because it offers an Excel-like experience. Choose the component that works best for you.

Decisions Component
Decisions are logic-type components often used in if/then scenarios. Let's look at an example. If your end-user selects radio button A, then show field B. Or if your end-user types value X, then display pop-up Y


 Initializer components watch for end-user interactions before triggering certain operations. 

Plug-In component is how you connect your module to the outside world. 


Checkpoint Component
The Checkpoint component helps you track your end-user's location in your application.

Plaid Component
Plaid is a service that lets your applications securely connect to bank accounts

File Storage Component
Retrieve a directory listing. Then, return an array of objects representing items in the remote directory.
Retrieve a file from a remote SFTP service and return an object with file content.
Upload data to a remote server.

*When you use Primary Fields and Secondary Fields alone, your application remains static

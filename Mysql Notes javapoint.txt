SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP



SELECT: it extracts data from a database.
UPDATE: it updates data in database.
DELETE: it deletes data from database.
CREATE TABLE: it creates a new table.
ALTER TABLE: it is used to modify the table.
DROP TABLE: it deletes a table.
CREATE DATABASE: it creates a new database.
ALTER DATABASE: It is used to modify a database.
INSERT INTO: it inserts new data into a database.
CREATE INDEX: it is used to create an index (search key).
DROP INDEX: it deletes an index.

Data types mainly classified into three categories for every database.

String Data types
Numeric Data types
Date and time Data types

Generally there are three types of operators in SQL:

SQL Arithmetic Operators
SQL Comparison Operators
SQL Logical Operators


Operator	Description
ALL	this is used to compare a value to all values in another value set.
AND	this operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement.
ANY	this operator is used to compare the value in list according to the condition.
BETWEEN	this operator is used to search for values, that are within a set of values
IN	this operator is used to compare a value to that specified list value
NOT	the NOT operator reverse the meaning of any logical operator
OR	this operator is used to combine multiple conditions in SQL statements
EXISTS	the EXISTS operator is used to search for the presence of a row in a specified table
LIKE	this operator is used to compare a value to similar values using wildcard operator

CREATE TABLE Employee(  
EmployeeID NOT NULL,  
FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,  
LastName varchar(255),  
City varchar(255),  
PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID)  
); 



Difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE statements
There is a slight difference b/w delete and truncate statement.
 The DELETE statement only deletes the rows from the table based on the condition defined by WHERE clause or delete all 
the rows from the table when condition is not specified.
But it does not free the space containing by the table.
The TRUNCATE statement: it is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the containing space.
